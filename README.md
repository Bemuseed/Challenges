# LoraRemixer

**LoraRemixer** is a simple, interactive program written in Python that lets you easily merge, compare and prune a set of stable diffusion LoRa models iteratively, with the intention of finding novel, undiscovered art styles.

You can find my blog post on the whole project [here](https://bemuseed.github.io/posts/novelartstyleswithai/novelartstyleswithai.html), including how I used ControlNet to try and standardized training LoRas for styles. You can also read my [how-to guide](https://bemuseed.github.io/posts/flattening-unflattening-stable-diffusion-models/flattening-unflattening-stable-diffusion-models.html) on comparing Stable Diffusion models to each-other.
